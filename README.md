**Emotionally-Congruent Music Generation**

The following project is a Siamese Neural Network built in Python to generate emotionally-congruent music across 4 genres (Rock, Electronic, Classical, and Pop Music) to evoke feelings of calmness
and energy. This is based on my findings upon producing a literature review studying affective computing and neurologic foundation of music therapy and has been designed for accessible receptive music therapy.
